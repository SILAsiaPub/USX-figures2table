Transformation Information.

This transformation takes a set of USX files exported from Paratext and creates 
a figures list for inclusion in a spreadsheet.

To Use:

1. Ensure that Java is installed on your computer and is in your path. A standard 
   installation does this for you.
2. Export USX files from Paratext.
3. Double click the transform.hta from Windows Explorer
4. Click the Edit Project button.
   a. Edit the project.txt file and change USX path to where your USX files are 
   located.
   b. Change the divider character to | if you don't want a tab!
   c. Save and close the project.txt file.
5. Click the Run Transformation button.
   If the black command window appears and dissappears that is good everything 
   should have worked.
   If the black command window stays showing then there was a problem. Errors 
   occured.
6. The created outfile will be opened in Notepad. If you used tab 
   separators/dividers you can copy and paste into your spread sheet.
